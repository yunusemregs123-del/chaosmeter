            <p>The first quarter of 2024 has seen a <strong>300% increase</strong> in AI-driven phishing attacks globally. Our sensors indicate a shift from traditional brute-force methods to sophisticated social engineering campaigns.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ransomware groups are now targeting backup systems first.</li>
                <li>IoT botnets have growing capacity, exceeding 10 Tbps.</li>
                <li>Supply chain attacks remain the primary vector for enterprise breaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>We recommend all nodes to update their DEFCON protocols immediately. The Chaos Index suggests a rising entropy in the digital sphere.</p>

            <p><strong>Impact on Infrastructure:</strong></p>
            <p>Geomagnetic storms can induce currents in long conductors like power lines. We advise grid operators to monitor GICs (Geomagnetically Induced Currents) closely.</p>
